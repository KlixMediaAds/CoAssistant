[ME]: "Hi, this is Josh from Kolasa Ag Systems. I'm working with a few producers in your area to lower their fungicide application costs this season. Are you currently spraying by plane or ground rig?"
[THEM]: Hello this is Seed Farms, we are currently spraying with ground rig.
[ME]: Understood. The T50 is great for hitting fields when the ground is too wet for the high-clearance rig. It keeps you moving when the wheels can't turn.
[THEM]: Okay?
[ME]: I'm not a dealer, I'm a consultant. I help farmers find the best inventory and pricing.
[THEM]: So what do you want?
[ME]: I have a PDF breakdown that compares the T50 operating cost vs hiring a plane. Can I email that to you to look over?
