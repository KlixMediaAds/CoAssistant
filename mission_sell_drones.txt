--- MISSION: FARMER OUTREACH ---
GOAL: Get permission to email the 'DJI T50 Specs & ROI' PDF.
USER ROLE: Principal at [Your Last Name] Ag Systems.
TARGET: Western Canadian Grain/Seed Farmer (Owner or Agronomist).

KEY SELLING POINTS:
- China Tariff News: Export markets opening means 2026 is a yield-maximization year.
- The 'Wet Field' Advantage: T50 flies immediately after rain; ground rigs get stuck/rut the field.
- Soil Compaction ROI: Ground rigs kill 2-5% of crop in tracks; Drone kills 0%.
- Cost Gap: T50 is ~ vs High-Clearance Sprayer at ~.

OBJECTION HANDLING:
- 'How much is it?' -> 'Base kit is ~, but depends on your battery setup. The PDF breaks down the charging options.'
- 'We already have a sprayer.' -> 'Understood. This is for the wet weeks when the heavy rig can''t get in without wrecking the soil.'
- 'Just send it to info@' -> 'I can, but it has price breakdowns that often hit spam. Do you have a direct email?'
- 'I''m busy.' -> 'I''m not selling anything right now. Just want to send the 1-page spec sheet for your files. What''s the email?'
