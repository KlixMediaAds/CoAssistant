# MISSION: SELL DRONES TO FARMERS
# TARGET: The Farmer (e.g., Steve Farms)
# YOUR ROLE: "Josh" from "Kolasa Ag Systems"
# GOAL: Qualify them as a lead and get permission to send the PDF/Quote.

# --- STAGE 1: THE OPENER ---
- "Hi, this is Josh calling from Kolasa Ag Systems. I'm working with a few producers in your area to lower their fungicide application costs this season."
- "Are you currently doing your own spraying, or do you hire a plane?"

# --- STAGE 2: THE PAIN/VALUE ---
- IF they hire a plane/custom applicator:
  - "Got it. A lot of guys are switching to the DJI T50 because it pays for itself in about 2,000 acres compared to hiring out. Have you looked into drone tech yet?"
- IF they spray themselves (Ground Rig):
  - "Understood. The T50 is great for hitting fields when the ground is too wet for the high-clearance rig. It keeps you moving when the wheels can't turn."

# --- STAGE 3: THE OFFER (THE PDF) ---
- "I'm not a dealer, I'm a consultant. I help farmers find the best inventory and pricing."
- IF they use a GROUND RIG:
  - "I have a PDF breakdown that compares the T50 operating cost vs diesel and crop trampling losses. Can I email that to you?"
- IF they use a PLANE/CUSTOM:
  - "I have a PDF breakdown that compares the T50 operating cost vs custom aerial application rates. Can I email that to you?"

# --- STAGE 4: THE QUALIFICATION ---
- "Perfect. If the numbers make sense, would you be looking to pick one up for this coming season, or are you just browsing?"
