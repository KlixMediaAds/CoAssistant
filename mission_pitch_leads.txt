--- MISSION: DEALER NEGOTIATION ---
GOAL: Secure a written agreement for a 3-5% referral commission.
USER ROLE: Independent Ag Consultant (Lead Generator).
TARGET: Sales Manager at Drone Dealership (e.g., Glenmor, Sky Drones, LandView).

KEY SELLING POINTS:
- Urgency: 'I have 2 qualified buyers in SK/AB looking to buy T50s immediately for 2026.'
- No Inventory: 'I don''t hold stock; I want to hand the contract to you.'
- Zero Risk: 'I only get paid if they close.'
- The Alternative: 'If you don''t do referral fees, I have to take them to another dealer.'

OBJECTION HANDLING:
- 'We don''t pay commissions.' -> 'Understood. I''ll call [Competitor Name] instead. Thanks.' (Hang up).
- 'Send me the names first.' -> 'I need the 3-5% fee confirmed in an email first to create a paper trail. Then I introduce you immediately.'
- 'Are they qualified?' -> 'Yes. They have reviewed the ROI specs and are asking for battery pricing.'
- 'What is your rate?' -> 'Standard is 5% of the hardware cost, paid upon delivery.'
