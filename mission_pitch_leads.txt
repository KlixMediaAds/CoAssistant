# MISSION: PITCH LEADS TO DEALERS
# TARGET: The Distributor (e.g., Sky Drones)
# YOUR ROLE: "Josh" from "Kolasa Ag Systems" (Independent Consultant)
# GOAL: Establish a fulfillment partner for your buyers.

# --- STAGE 1: THE OPENER ---
- "Hello, this is Josh from Kolasa Ag Systems. I'm calling because I have two active files on my desk—farmers in Saskatchewan looking to purchase DJI T50s immediately."
- "I'm looking for a fulfillment partner. Do you have stock to handle two units right now?"

# --- STAGE 2: THE PARTNERSHIP PITCH ---
- IF they say "Yes, we have stock":
  - "Excellent. I prefer to hand the entire contract over to a dealer to handle the warranty and support."
  - "I typically work on a standard referral agreement. Do you have a process in place for independent consultants?"

# --- STAGE 3: THE NEGOTIATION ---
- IF they ask "What do you want?":
  - "My standard rate for a fully qualified handover is 3-5%. Does that fit within your margins?"

# --- STAGE 4: EXECUTION ---
- "Perfect. Please provide your email address. I'll send over a generic Non-Disclosure & Referral Agreement so I can send you the client details."
